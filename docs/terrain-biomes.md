# Terrain and biome synthesis (phase V1)

**Status:** V1a implemented on 2026-10-19 and reviewed by the owner in game (C55): it loads and renders; four defects led to V1a.1 (generator 0.5.0, below), which the owner accepted in game (C58). Generated rivers (V1b) are still to do. NOT GAME VALIDATED.

## Problem

The owner reviewed the generated New World in EU5 1.4.1 on 2026-10-19 [V-GAME owner observation]. Coasts and water were fixed, but up close the land looked pixelated: forests and other biomes showed many small squares, borders were rough, biomes did not fill coherent areas, and transitions were not smooth. Generation must use a deliberate algorithm, not noise plus random patches.

## How EU5 draws land

Investigation of the 1.4.1 files changed the plan [V-LOCAL C50; V-EXEC C51, C52]:

- **Biome per location.** The shader samples a per-location biome texture through the location colour map (`main_menu/gfx/FX/cw/terrain2_biomes.fxh`). The biome is chosen from the location template's climate, vegetation and topography in `gfx/map/biome_definitions/biomes.txt`. A coherent look therefore needs coherent templates.
- **The material layer stores slots, not textures.** Every biome in `gfx/terrain2/materials.txt` lists 16 materials (a few list 17). The decal layer selects one of them per pixel by role:

  | Slots | Role | Vanilla rule |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0–4 | Coast, chosen by the location's topography (flatland, hills, plateau, mountains, wetlands) | 1–4 px inland; 2–6 px offshore |
  | 5 | Coast transition | 4–10 px inland |
  | 6 | Rivers, lake and sea edges | 0–3 px around river pixels; 5–10 px offshore |
  | 7 | Topography border | Band of about ±4 px around location borders where topography changes |
  | 8 | Vegetation border | Same band where vegetation changes |
  | 9 | Climate border | Same band where climate changes |
  | 10–15 | Two families of three variations | Family blobs about 25 px; level blobs about 8 px |

  Where several attributes change at once, topography wins, then vegetation, then climate. Some changes get no band: flatland ↔ flatland wasteland, arid ↔ hot semi-arid, cold arid ↔ cold semi-arid, arctic ↔ subpolar. Level shares depend on vegetation and topography; forest uses level 1 only. Pixels are decal pixels, two per location pixel.
- **Short material lists.** Only 33 of 191 biome lists have 16 entries; 93 have 13 (no second variation family), others 12, 14 or 15, and `arid_plateau_desert_biome` has one. The shader clamps the slot to 15 and reads a fixed table whose unlisted entries most likely point at material 0, `fallback_material` (dead grass) [V-LOCAL C54; INFERRED]. Vanilla writes the missing slots anyway; generated land does not (stage 5).
- **Trees and ground clutter are pre-placed instances.** They live in `gfx/map/map_objects/*_generator_*.bin` (40-byte records: x, y, z, quaternion, scale) and in three inline `jungle_dense` text files. 27–44% of the forest, pine, jungle, woods and grass instances stood on the removed Americas.

The interim patch transfer copied river and border bands from unrelated places and took templates from random donors. That produced the squares and the mosaic (C47).

## Algorithm (implemented)

| Stage | Module | Method |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Relief | `relief.py` | One continuous height field in decal units. Mountain chains follow noise zero lines (belts) whose width and edges vary, cut into segments by a presence noise, with ridged crests; plus foothills, hill country, plateaus, a broad tilt and an inland rise. All noise uses rotated lattices and domain warping, so nothing aligns with the raster. Ramps use a Euclidean distance to the sea. The highest cells become wastelands. |
| 2. Climate | `climate.py`, `eu5_biomes.py` | Absolute latitude comes from city-locator anchors (C49). Rainfall comes from zonal winds: easterlies below 30°, westerlies from 30° to 60°, polar easterlies above, blended across the band edges. The sea recharges moisture (an ocean fully, a strait little). Land loses a fixed share per pixel plus an orographic share on smoothed terrain, which gives rain shadow behind ranges. The same model runs on the vanilla map and on the generated map. |
| 3. Classification | `eu5_biomes.py` | Integer k-nearest-neighbour vote (k = 32) over about 18,000 Old World land locations, on latitude, rainfall, mean height and distance to the sea. It predicts climate first, then vegetation within the chosen climate. Farmland is learned as grassland, because the New World starts empty. Sea and lake climates come from vanilla sea zones by latitude and distance to land. |
| 4. Coherence | `eu5_biomes.py` | Class scores are smoothed over the location adjacency graph: 3 rounds for climate, 1 for vegetation. Topography comes from relief ranks in vanilla proportions (mountains, plateaus, hills, wetlands, flatland), using height, height spread, rainfall and distance to the coast. Desert cells never become wetlands, because no biome covers that combination (C54). |
| 5. Material slots | `eu5_slots.py` | The vanilla rules above, applied to the generated labels and templates. Band edges, variation families and levels come from uniformised integer noise in absolute decal coordinates, so adjacent decals agree. Each label's biome is resolved through `biomes.txt` (most specific rule); a slot its material list lacks becomes the same variation level of the first family, else the highest listed level, else slot 0. |
| 6. Gameplay consistency | `eu5_nw_export.py` | Each location template gets the model's climate, vegetation and topography. Raw materials are drawn from vanilla frequencies for the same climate, vegetation, topography and coastal flag. |
| 7. Vegetation instances | `eu5_objects.py` | Vanilla instances inside the canvas are dropped. New instances are sampled per material pixel at the Old World density for the pixel's (vegetation, climate, topography, slot) class. Rotation and scale are copied from vanilla records of the same file. |
| 8. Location shapes | `newworld.py` | Cell borders are bent by a smooth displacement field, then cut-off pieces are re-attached, so borders and the bands along them are organic rather than polygonal. A meandering strait keeps land at least 24 px from the map wrap. City points maximise `min(2 × distance to the cell border, distance to water)`, so coastal cities stand inland. |

## Acceptance results (seed 42, continents) [V-EXEC C51–C53]

- **Slot-rule fidelity:** rebuilding a 1600×2400 vanilla Mediterranean crop from vanilla templates gives 85.6% agreement on structural classes. Coast slot choice is right on 96% of coast pixels. The optional local test requires at least 80%.
- **Biome coherence:** the share of adjacent location pairs with the same climate is 919‰ (vanilla Old World 806‰); for vegetation it is 854‰ (vanilla 631‰). Mean region size is 86 and 38 locations (vanilla 13 and 7). Zones are deliberately more coherent than vanilla's location-level mosaic.
- **Climate bands:** tropical at 0–20°; subtropical and arid at 20–35°; Mediterranean and cold arid at 35–45°; continental at 45–55°; subpolar at 55–65°; arctic above 65°.
- **Vegetation instances:** density per 1000 location pixels, generated versus Old World:

  | Instances | Generated | Old World |
  |---|---|---|
  | Forest trees in forest | 75 | 90 |
  | Pine in forest | 344 | 283 |
  | Jungle trees in jungle | 387 | 299 |
  | Woods trees in woods | 97 | 75 |
  | Grass in grassland | 107 | 99 |

  None are placed on desert, sparse land or water.
- **Owner review in game (C55):** loads and renders. Defects and fixes (C56; V1a.1 build C57):

  | Defect | Cause | V1a.1 fix |
  |---|---|---|
  | Wide crack along the map wrap in the north-west | EU5 does not stitch terrain across x = 0; 1,390 rows of generated land crossed it (vanilla: one islet) | Strait along the seam: no land within 24 px, coasts on a ramp shifted by warped noise so the strait meanders and changes width |
  | Square city models with a corner in water | Large models next to the crack or a near shore; cities were already 8+ px from water | City points pushed inland: coastal cities now 11 px from water at the 1st percentile, 28 px at the median (were 8 and 21) |
  | Brown pixel-staircase patches in white desert | Slots 13–15 in 13-entry biomes such as `arid_hills_desert_biome` render `fallback_material` | Only listed slots are written on generated land; desert cells no longer become wetlands, which have no biome |
  | Green city ground in sand | Vanilla `city_materials` gives every non-Mediterranean biome the green peasant decal; models come from donor cultures | Not changed: an override would also change Old World deserts; native cultures are R6 |

## Open work

- **V1b rivers:** flow accumulation on the relief, river lines in `rivers.png` (palette 0 for sources, rare 1 and 2 probably for joins and splits [INFERRED], 4/5/11/15 for bodies with exactly two 4-neighbours [V-EXEC C52]), valleys carved into the heights, slot 6 along them.
- Mountain mesh decals on generated ranges (vanilla covers about 57% of mountain interiors with them).
- Erosion for more natural valleys.
- The mod is about 1.3 GB, because instance files are whole-file overrides.
